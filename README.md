# turnaroundTime

A Python program that reads emails in an inbox and parses them for their subject, sender and reciever. All of the emails in this inbox will be replies to other emails. The program will then attempt to find both the time that the reply email was sent and when the original email was sent (in Greenwich Standard Time). It finally calculates the "turnaround time" of the email. After this data has been read the program will output this data in an excel spreadsheet.
